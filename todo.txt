// 1. Add helpers to specific mod commands
//  - Helpers should have the ability to mute, // warn, // kick, and // pull up a user's history 
2. Automatically delete posts longer than 8 lines in #trade-posts
3. Custom commands delete trigger message
 - We have a few commands that were learned wrong, and they are triggered by an emoji. They don't delete with the !forget command
4. Unable to forget custom commands that include emojis in them; bot confirms it deleted commands that dont even exist
// 5. Nickname command checks for wrong perm
 
// 6. Allows indefinite mutes without reason
//  - There's an issue with indefinite mutes, where sometimes they won't mute a user with or without a reason. We had a time where we muted someone and the command worked, but neither the mute or reason were logged. Just funky
// 7. Role hierarchy (admin can't ban owner, etc) -> // KICK, // MUTE, // BAN, // WARN
// 8. Fix division
// 9. Remove restriction to mod-logs for some commands, allow them in all staff channels


// Also the math command has trouble with division, especially when decimals are involved

// History, recallban, recallkick will only display in #mod-logs. We would prefer it to display in whatever channel the command is used in

One last thing! !addrole @user [role name] wont work u less you ping the role
It should add the role whether you type out the role name or ping it

Nicknames must be 32 chars or fewer
Find Invalid Form Body error
