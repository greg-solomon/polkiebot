I have tentatively made the following changes:
 - Helpers can mute, warn, kick, and pull up history
 - Role hierarchy -> mod commands can not be executed if the sender has a highest role lower than that of the person they are trying to warn/mute/kick etc.
 - Fixed the issue with the math command not handling decimals and division
 - History, recallban, recallkick now display in the channels that they are queried in
 - !addrole works with role pings and typing it out as well. 
 - !nick rejects names longer than 32 characters
 - !nick works with role hierarchy, added back up message to say that any issues with self nicknames can be resolved with the built in /nick command

 
I have not been able to replicate the issue with the custom commands and emojis.

I have removed timed mutes for simplicity. I am working on a big bot right now and I am looking to have timed mutes as a feature so I will update this bot when I have a better solution. 
Mute is now `!mute [@user|id] [reason?]`

I have added better logging so when the issues arise in this next build I will be better able to diagnose them.

Thank you for your patience I will be putting this new build on your VPS shortly.
